# Crystal Collector Game
A remake of the crystal collector game based on jQuery instead of Vanilla JavaScript.

## Game Play
1. The player will be guessing an answer with numbers.
2. There will be four crystals displayed as buttons.
3. At the start of the game, there will be a random number shown to the player.
4. Whenever the player clicks on a crystal, there will be a certain amount of points added to the player's overall score.

## Game Notes
1. The score will be hidden until the player clicks on a crystal.
2. Whenever the player clicks on a crystal, the score will be updated.
3. If the total score matches the random number from the beginning of the game, the player wins.
4. If the total score goes above the random number from the beginning of the game, the player loses.
5. Win or lose, the game will restart.
6. Whenever the game restarts, there will be a new random number displayed to the player. The crystals will also have four new hidden values with the total score
being set at zero.
7. The random number at the beginning of the game will be between 19 and 120.
8. Each crystal will have a hidden value between 1 and 12.

## Future Plans
Add a total score when a user loses. Change page elements to remove scroll.
